Hi，我叫三石。此时此刻，你停留于此，是我们的缘分。我呢，在读博士（传说是永久性大脑损伤学位），我坚信2019夏按时毕业。贴一位励志大牛的故事：

A story about ASPIRATION:
   
The normal duration of studies in the department of EECS of National Technical University of Athens, where I studied is five years. You have to take 60 classes in order to graduate. So naturally, nobody has ever attempted to graduate in less than five years. With the objective to find my boundaries, I set a goal of doing exactly that despite the advice of my father not to do it as I may compromising my grades and that might have an effect on being admitted on a top doctoral program, which has always been my goal. With lot of dedication and positive energy, I finished my studies in four years and was accepted as a doctoral student at the department of applied mathematics at MIT in 1985. When I came to the mathematics department at MIT I learnt about the Operations Research Center and I loved it. So I decided to try to finish a PhD in both programs and try to do it in 3 years. Again with dedication and positive energy, I finished my studies in 1988, the year I joined the Sloan school as an assistant professor. In the summer of 1989, as an assistant professor I set a goal to prove that a central algorithm in optimization was faster than previously thought possible. This would have been a major research development. We were moving houses that summer and my wife complains that I did not help in the move as the proof was coming any minute. In the end I did not succeed in this goal, but my understanding of optimization deepened considerably. As a professor, I have tried to teach my students to aim high, even higher that they think they can achieve and dedicate themselves to achieve it. I have observed both from my personal experience as well as from the experience of my students that those that have a positive orientation towards the goals they set typically achieve them. In fact, it has been my experience that the most important quality for determining success in life, more than IQ or EQ is positive energy, the belief that you will succeed in whatever you set out to achieve. It is exactly this belief that I hope we installed in you, which I hope will be with you for the rest of your life.

在这里，我会视具体情况整理各种各样的问题，不设限。目前想到的应该会有优化问题和非常基础的编程知识（我的专业），儿童教育（我的兴趣点），读书观影笔记（我的兴趣点），生活随笔感悟（我本身），也会粘一些图片。不刻意要求百分百的正确性，因为，相比追求正确，说自己的话，表自己的意更值得。
 </p>

  如果任何一个字，任何一句话能成为连接你我的语言，我会很兴奋！

可以是纯粹的科学研究的整理，可以单纯是心理过程的再现，但不能是经历的备忘录，写经历可以，必须加以分析，否则经历只是零碎的事实，与心智无关。当然了，偶尔贴贴图片也是很好地。

毛姆说： “你之所以按某种方式思维，所以才按某种方式行事；实际上，你之所以按某种方式思维，倒是因为你是某种方式造就而成的。真理与此毫不相干，压根儿就没有“真理”这种
   东西。每个人都有其一套哲学。过去的伟人先哲煞费苦心炮制的整套观念，仅仅对著作者自己有效。”
 </p>
 
<p>
毛姆还说： “处在当时那种情况之下，个人的想法是多么的无足轻重。”

 喔，走到哪里，哪里就是路，做了什么，什么就是界限
